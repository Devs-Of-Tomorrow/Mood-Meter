# Mood-Meter

Let’s understand with flow 

First 'homepage1' will be shown to user 
Which will contain all intro stuff with log in, sign up btns 




Now assume he clicks on sign up btn the signup page2 will be shown to him which will contain typical fields 
Also it will contain the person/employee Code 
For e.g. 45ROHIT@BCCI -> id-name-company name 
Now from this code we know that user is Rohit who is employee of BCCI 
Data will be served accordingly 




Now he lands on the employee homepage3  
He can see daily moodmetere   i) scale type , ii) radio btn with emoji, ii) direct emoji selection
We will try all but better one will be chosen

There will be the weekly form4 with questions and answers which probably MCQ’s only
Form will be given/activated i)exact 7  days after submitting ii) only Sunday to Sunday 
 i will be there but we will try ii also   

Also we can try the reminder section on page similar to the alarm we will ask for particular time for reminding 
For e.g. he selects 10 am then the reminder msg will be sent on his what’s App or also can try  other ways for notifying him 

Now he submits the response 
The personalized data page5 will be served where his data will be shown in monthly divided form and also the processed data/analysed data(avg mood etc) will be shown and the suggations accordingly 

Login form6 will be with typical fields

First homepage1 will be shown to user 
Which will contain all intro stuff with log in, sign up btns 

Now assume he clicks on sign up btn the signup page2 will be shown to him which will contain normal fields 
Also it will contain the person/employee Code 
For e.g. GANGULY_ADMIN@BCCI -> name-admin-company name

Now he lands on the Admin homepage7  
Which contains dashboard with graph and other visual formed data

We can show table with employee id, name 
Id	Employee

2	Amir
3	Roshith
4	Nitin

Admin clicks on name of any one employee and his gets data for same  

Also we can create search btn on top so he can type employee name and get employee details
For testing  we will try searchin by the CODE if that succeeds we can try directly by name 

We can also make a leaderboard7 with top 3 employees , bottom 3 employees etc 
Leaderboard will be visible for Admin only
We will try all and Finalise the best combination out of the above Features
